# Polynomial curve visualizer for Growth Curve Anlayses

This is an interactive tool that allows users to visualize the contribution of each polynomial term to the total polynomial function. 

Users can interact with the app using sliders or numeric inputs (for example, that correspond to the coefficients of a GCA model).
